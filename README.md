# Inventory_Decoder
A project I did in UCLA CS32 for Spring 2019

This project entailed a file that was specifically formatted to show beginnings and ends of inventory items and quantities with a certain character. My task was to decode the very long string in a swift fashion using hast tables in order to separate the items out and see what the difference in inventory was between the day before and the day of.

If I remember correctly, this project submission got ~97% with performance being the bulk of the grade- the algorithm was more than optimal solution that the professor had ready, but there was good competition :P
